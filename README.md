## Repository owner: Eren Derinbay

### Project management
We decided to use GitHub Projects for our project management tool since we’re already using GitHub to host our repositories. It provides a single common platform to manage both, which makes it a lot easier than having to use multiple websites.

### Branching strategy
GitHub Flow will be used for this project, as it keeps things simple with a single Main branch.
